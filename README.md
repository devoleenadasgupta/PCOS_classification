# PCOS_classification
This project aims to classify Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning, leveraging real-world medical data. The first step involves loading datasets from an Excel file and a CSV file, both containing key health indicators related to PCOS. An initial exploration is conducted to get a sense of the dataâ€”checking for missing values, understanding the structure, and identifying important features that could play a role in diagnosing PCOS.
After cleaning and preprocessing the data, it is split into training and testing sets to ensure a fair evaluation of the machine learning models. Feature selection techniques may also be used to pinpoint the most relevant predictors, helping to refine the model and eliminate unnecessary noise.
Next, different machine learning models are trained to classify PCOS cases. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests are likely used since they are well-suited for medical classification problems. These models learn from past patient data and are then tested on unseen cases to assess how well they can predict PCOS.
To gauge the accuracy of these models, performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are analyzed. A confusion matrix is also generated to better understand how well the model distinguishes between PCOS-positive and PCOS-negative cases.
